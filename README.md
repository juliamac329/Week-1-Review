This is my Week 1 Review for Grade 12 Computer Science (ICS4U). It is a review of the important concepts learned in Grade 11 Introduction to Compter Science (ISC3U).

Project 1: Quadratic Formula Solver
Task: Write a program that solves a quadratic equation in standard form using the quadratic formula. Check if the equation has zero, one, or two solutions first, using the discriminant, and then output any solutions (if there are any).

Project 2: Attendance
Task: A student is not allowed to write a University exam if their attendance is less than 75%. Write a program that accepts the number of classes held, the number of classes attended and print out the attendance % and if they are allowed to write the exam or not

Project 3: Sequence
Task: Let the user input a positive integer.
If the number is even, divide it by 2.
If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Take the new number you generated and repeat the process. If you repeat this process enough times then eventually the number you generate will always equal to 1. Write a program outputs the sequence of numbers until it gets to 1

Project 4: Perfect Numbers
Task: Create a function that determines if a number is a perfect number and then find the first 500 perfect numbers starting at 1. 
A number is perfect if all of its factors (excluding the number itself) add up to the number. 
6 is perfect because it has factors 1,2,3,6 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Project 5: Exponents Function
Task: Create a function that does power functions a^b without using the built in exponents functions in Java

Project 6: Palindrome
Task: Write a program that checks if a single word entered from the user is a palindrome.  

Project 7: Counting List
Task: Write a program that displays a random list of 75 numbers between 15 and 50 to the user.  Once that list is displayed, ask them for a target number to search for.  Display how many of the target values are in the list

Project 8: Alternating List
Task: Write a program that generates a random list of numbers between 0 and 100.  The size of the list is random between 4 and 20 and must be an even number.  Output a new list in alternating reverse order

Ex.  If the list is [1,2,3,4,5,6] then output [1,6,2,5,3,4]
